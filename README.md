>This repository documents the development of an LSTM and ARIMA model in MATLAB.  

### ___Data acquisition:___

- [x] There are 84 observations missing between 07/02/1984 to 01/03/1991. 
- [x] Since this period is large (> 3 years) classic data implementation methods such as linear interpolation was not employed as it assumes explicit linearity between observations. 

The time series used therefore began from 01/03/1991 to 30/09/2020, the latest measurement at the time.

### ___Procedure:___
The steps to develop the models can essentially be broken down into **7** key stages outlined as follows: 

*#1* :mag: Selection of relevant input variables via exploratory time series analysis (Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation, modified Mann-Kendall trend test...)

*#2* :wrench: Time series reconstruction

Step-by-step of algorithm developed for time series reconstruction for month, _i_.  
Where _Q<sub>i, j</sub>_ is the observation on day _j_ of the _i<sup>th</sup>_ month. 
1. First, the rolling 7-day sums of river flow volume, was calculated within month, _i_. The largest 7-day river flow volume within that month, _Q<sub>i, max</sub>_, is then the _i<sup>th</sup>_ observation of the new time series. 
2. This process was repeated for all 355 months i.e., until _i=355_. 

Note: The number of days in a given month ranges from 28 to 31, the example above, demonstrates the algorithm on a month with 30 days, but it is applicable to all month sizes.

*#3* :chart_with_downwards_trend: Stationary characteristic analysis (SSA time series decomposition, modified Leybourne-McCabe stationary test...)

The SSA decomposition of monthly maximum 7-day river flow volume time series into long-term trend, seasonal and irregular components. Components with nonnegative values (a) and (c) show the same data range to aid comparisons.

*#4* :computer: Pre-processing (differencing, partioning, normalisation)

The reconstructed time series above shows the pre-processing steps at each stage. 
The calibration period the first 90% of the time series was used to calibrate the ARIMA and LSTM models and the remaining 10%, highlighted in red from month 319 to 355 inclusive, was the forecasting period.

*#5* :brain: LSTM calibration 

Hyperparameters of the LSTM were adjusted via Bayesian Optimisation to avoid over-fitting. After, 50 trials the combination of hyperparameters that produced the lowest RMSE (see Section 4.3.2) was used for the final LSTM neural network configuration.  
The 'Adam' optimisation algorithm was also implemented to improve LSTM performance.

*#6* :chart_with_upwards_trend: ARIMA calibration (BIC, ACF and PACF)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86715613/174204833-8af50cce-7c1f-4969-8a8e-0e4e9f9cdb71.png)

A total of 16 autoregressive model combinations models each of which were fitted to the time series, where 1≤p≤4 and 1≤q≤4. 
Once fitted, the BIC was calculated for each mode.  
The model which minimised the BIC was deemed to be of the best fit.
The BIC values were used in conjunction with the ACF and PACF correlograms shown above to verify the BIC results. (a) ACF correlogram (b) PACF correlogram. The significance bounds of both correlograms are at ±5% of the zero line 

*#7* :bar_chart: Model performance evaluation (R<sup>2</sup>, modified Nash-Sutcliffe index...)

(a) R<sup>2</sup>, (b) MNS and (c) RMSE from forecast periods 1 to 6 for LSTM and ARIMA(4, 1, 4) models. The results of the ARIMA(4, 1, 4) are orange and LSTM are in purple.

Further assessment of model bias and variance were also conducted formally via the Shapiro-Wilk test and graphically via Q-Q plots and histograms.
